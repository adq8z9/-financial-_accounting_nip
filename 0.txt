General Ledger Data.

This aip aims to describe the structure for the general ledger data on wire as well as the basic flow description.
It is leaned on/ copied from nostr-protocol. So in doubt one should refere to this.


General ledger entry:

Format -

{
  "id": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded sha256 of the serialized posting data>,
  "pubkey": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded public key of the posting creator>,
  "created_at": <unix timestamp in seconds>,
  "kind": <64-bit integer kind number, for the general ledger entry 0>,
  //("tags"/"refs"):
  "accounting_area": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded id of the accounting area structure kind 1 event reference below for which is booked>,
  "movement_type", <64-bit integer for movement type defined in aips>
  "subledger_reference", <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded id of a subledger reference posting>, <64-bit integer kind number of referenced subledger posting>
  "posting_partner", <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded id of the accounting area structure kind 1 event reference who is the partner of the transaction>]
  //("content"/"postings"):
  "posting_period": <unix timestamp in seconds for when the booking should be categorized in contrast to creation date>,
  "journal_entries", [[<64-bit integer for account number from account data structure>, <financial data amount in smallest unit of the general ledger currency>], [...], ... ],
  "sig": <64-bytes lowercase hex of the signature of the sha256 hash of the serialized event data, which is the same as the "id" field>
}

In a general ledger entry the amounts in the "journal_entries" tags should overall sum up to zero.
Positive amount is a debit entry, a negative amount a credit entry (or interpreted like amount goes from (negative amount accounts) to (positive amount accounts).

This aip should introduce the "movement_type" (0, "general ledger movement"), "kind" (0, "general ledger entry")
