General Ledger Data.

This aip aims to describe the structure for the general ledger data on wire as well as the basic flow description.
It is leaned on nostr-protocol. So in doubt one should refere to this.


The general ledger data consists of two main structures:

 1. A chart of accounts defining the accounts to be booked on

 2. A general ledger entry defining a movement/entry on the accounts


Chart of accounts:




General ledger entry:

Format -

{
  "id": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded sha256 of the serialized posting data>,
  "kind": <32-byte kind number mostly aequivalent with the aip number>,
  "poster": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded public key of the posting creator>,
  "created_at": <unix timestamp in seconds>,
  "accounting_area": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded public key of the accounting area for which is booked>,
  "posting_period": <unix timestamp in seconds>,
  "journal_entries": \[
    \[<32-byte account number>, <financial data amount in smallest unit of the general ledger currency>\, <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded public key of the partner of the financial data>], 
    // ...
  \],
  "subledger_reference": \[Number according to the referenced AIP which specify the subleder, reference number from other AIP\],
  "sig": <64-bytes lowercase hex of the signature of the sha256 hash of the serialized event data, which is the same as the "id" field>
}

In a general ledger entry the amounts in the "journal_entries" tags should overall sum up to zero.
